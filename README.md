# Pomodoro App - Mobile App 1

This is a small-scale mobile app intended to help us get familiar with React Native, launching an app on the iOS and Google Play app stores, and generally learn about mobile app development.

## Features

The app has a limited set of features, and currently all data storage occurs locally. That will be described more later on.

### The Timer

The timer is the main part of the app. To mimic the "Pomodoro Method", there are 6 "rounds" per "set", and once the 6th round has been completed, the user is brought back to the 1st round of the next set.

The six rounds are as follows:

1. Work Round (25 Minutes)
2. Short Break Round (5 Minutes)
3. Work Round (25 Minutes)
4. Short Break Round (5 Minutes)
5. Work Round (25 Minutes)
6. Long Break Round (20 Minutes)
